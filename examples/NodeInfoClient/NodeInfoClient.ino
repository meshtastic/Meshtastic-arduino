/*
    Meshtastic NodeInfo client

    Connects to a Meshtastic node via WiFi or Serial (and maybe one day Bluetooth),
    asks it for information about itself and all other nodes in the mesh that it
    knows about, and prints a report on their basic characteristics, including all
    available location data

    To use, get an Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi (or some other board, but then edit
    the pin config below) and put your Meshtastic node in WiFi AP mode, then put
    your SSID and wifi password in arduino_secrets.h and run this code with the
    serial monitor open.
